# make-orb

Growable crop that produces orbs used in a compressor to make various stuff, with various compressors to make different things

> Currently I only support Minetest Game, but in the future I'll support games like Mine Clone.

## How to use this?

First grab a copy of this mod and put it in your minetest's mod directory. (Restart your minetest server or client if needed)

Second in-game obtain a `makeorb:orb` (either by give or just look around for them).

Third place it on farmland and watch it grow. (once it grows just punch it to collect the grown orb, this can be used to expand your existing farm or used in crafting)

Fourth craft the various "compressors" special nodes with options to produce nodes/items consuming varying amounts of orbs in it's inventory. (Each type of compressor makes different things, for instance the Food Compressor produces Bread, and food like items while the Ore Compressor produces Coal, Steel/Iron, Gold, Diamond, Mese and other ore/ingot/crystal like items)

> In future versions I'll add a Storage tank which stores orbs and Compressors can pull from their inventory and from Storage tanks to satisfy costs.

## How does this work?

Basically this is [resource_crops](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TwigGlenn4/resource_crops/) but the code is not the same (Actually only for making the "plant"/"crop"), and only about 3-4 textures from resource crops (for the "crop"/"plant"), everything else is completely new/redesigned.

> Hopefully it will be better than any other resource production mod out there.
